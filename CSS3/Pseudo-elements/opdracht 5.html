        yawn. Where is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy
        squirrel! sugar, my siamese, stalks me (in a good way), day and night ,
        yet and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well
        why not. Use lap as chair destroy couch as revenge hiss at vacuum
        cleaner for hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy,
        grass smells good. Lick the other cats sit in box or decide to want
        nothing to do with my owner today. Damn that dog lick human with
        sandpaper tongue but make muffins, but chew master's slippers tuxedo
        cats always looking dapper. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr
        like a lawnmower hunt by meowing loudly at 5am next to human slave food
        dispenser eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming
        lie on counter don't get off counter fooled again thinking the dog likes
        me and caticus cuteicus. Pushes butt to face meow for food, then when
        human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing
        climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his
        face...
