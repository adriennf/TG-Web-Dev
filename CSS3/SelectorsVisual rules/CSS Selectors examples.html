    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li>Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)</li>
      <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)</li>
      <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)</li>
      <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)</li>
      <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="special">
      The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used
      to select one unique element!
    </h2>
    <h4>The element selector</h4>
    <p>
      The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
      Every paragraph and the h3 will be affected by the style color red.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page by
      text-align: center.
    </p>
    <p class="color">Paragraph, affected by a class: color purple.</p>

    <section class="bgcolor large">
      HTML elements can also refer to more than one class. This section refers
      to two classes: background-color and font-size.
    </section>
    <br />

    <h3>The CSS Grouping Selector</h3>
    <p>
      The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style
      definitions. To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma: h3,
      p.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h4>Descendant selector (space)</h4>
      <p>
        The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a
        specified element. The element element selector is used to select elements inside elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following example selects all &lt;p&gt; elements inside &lt;div&gt;
        elements: font-family:fantasy
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>Child Selector (>)</h4>
      <q
        >The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a
        specified element. The element>element selector is used to select
        elements with a specific parent. The following example selects all
        &lt;q&gt; elements, an quotation, that are children of a &lt;div&gt;
        element.</q
      >
    </div>
    <p>
      <a href="ExampleAdjacentSibling.html">Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</a><br>
      The element+element selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="./ExampleGeneralSibling.html">General Sibling Selector (~)</a><br>
      The element1~element2 selector matches occurrences of element2 that are preceded by element1.
      Both elements must have the same parent, but element2 does not have to be immediately preceded by element1.
    </p>
    
   
    <h4>Pseudo-classes</h4>
    
    <p>The syntax of pseudo-classes:<br>
      selector:pseudo-class {<br>
      property: value;<br>
    }</p>
    <p>The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. </p>
    <h5>Anchor Pseudo-classes</h5>
    <p>mouse over link: color: hot pink</p>
    <p>Mouse over the div element below to change its background color:</p>

<div>Mouse Over Me</div>
  
    <p><b>Note:</b> a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited in the CSS definition in order to be effective.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> a:active MUST come after a:hover in the CSS definition in order to be effective.</p>


    <h4>Pseudo-elements</h4>
    <p>
      A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.<br />
      For example: style the first letter, or line, of an element<br />
      Insert content before, or after, the content of an element<br />
      The syntax of pseudo-elements: selector::pseudo-element {<br />
      property: value;<br />
      }
     

    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <li>
        The ::first-line pseudo-element<br />
        is used to add a special style to the first line of a text and can only
        be applied to block-level elements.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Selector: p::first-letter, selects the first letter of all &lt;p&gt;
      elements.
